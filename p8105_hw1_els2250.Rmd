## Problem 1
First, we need to load the packages that we will be using for this homework assignment.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

##### Code for Dataset Summary: 
Next, we need to load the data and briefly view the data to understand important variables and values. 

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

summary(penguins)

head(penguins)

mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```
