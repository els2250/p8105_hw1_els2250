## Problem 1

First, we need to load the packages that we will be using for this
homework assignment.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──
    ## ✔ ggplot2 3.3.6      ✔ purrr   0.3.4 
    ## ✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10
    ## ✔ tidyr   1.2.0      ✔ stringr 1.4.1 
    ## ✔ readr   2.1.2      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 
    ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

``` r
library(palmerpenguins)
```

##### Code for Dataset Summary:

Next, we need to load the data and briefly view the data to understand
important variables and values.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

summary(penguins)
```

``` r

    ## # … with abbreviated variable names ¹​flipper_length_mm, ²​body_mass_g

``` r
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 200.9152

##### Summary of Dataset using Inline Code:

The `penguin` dataset consists of 344 rows and 8 columns. Below, the 8
rows representing the 8 variables in the dataset are summarized using
inline code.

Variable Summary:

-   *Species*: Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo
-   *Island*: Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen
-   *Bill length (mm)*: Range = 32.1 mm to 59.6 mm; Mean = 43.9219298 mm
-   *Bill depth (mm)*: Range = 13.1 mm to 21.5 mm; Mean = 17.1511696 mm
-   *Flipper length (mm)*: Range = 172 mm to 231 mm; Mean = 200.9152047
    mm
-   *Body mass (g)*: 2700 g to 6300 g; Mean = 4201.754386 g
-   *Sex*: Female, Male
-   *Year*: 2007, 2008, 2009

As noted above, the mean flipper length is 200.9152047 mm.

##### Plot for `penguin` Dataset (& Save):

Next, we will create a plot of penguin flipper length vs. bill length
using `ggplot` and save the plot as a PDF file.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)
```

![](p8105_hw1_els2250_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("flipper_length_vs_bill_length.pdf", w = 6, h = 4)
```

## Problem 2

##### Create a New Data Frame:

For Problem 2, we are creating a new data frame consisting of a numeric,
logical, character, and factor vector using `tibble`.

``` r
problem_2_df <- 
  tibble(
    numeric_vector = rnorm(10),
    logic_vector = numeric_vector > 0,
    character_vector = c("Washington", "Massachusetts", "New York", "Oregon", "California", "Maine", "Vermont", "New Hampshire", "Idaho", "Colorado"),
    factor_vector = factor(c("hot", "warm", "cold", "hot", "warm", "cold", "hot", "warm", "cold", "cold"))
  )
```

##### Taking the Mean of Data Frame Variables:

Next, we will attempt to take the mean of each variable to observe what
works and what does not work.

``` r
mean(pull(.data = problem_2_df, var = numeric_vector))
```

    ## [1] 0.06035696

``` r
mean(pull(.data = problem_2_df, var = logic_vector))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(pull(.data = problem_2_df, var = character_vector))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(.data = problem_2_df, var = character_vector)):
    ## argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(.data = problem_2_df, var = factor_vector))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(.data = problem_2_df, var = factor_vector)):
    ## argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

We are able to successfully generate the mean of the numeric and logic
vectors; however, the character and factor vectors produced `NA` as the
output.

##### Using `as.numeric` to Convert Variable Types:

To test how R calculates the mean of certain variables, we will attempt
to convert logical, character, and factor variables to numeric variables
using `as.numeric`.

``` r
as.numeric(problem_2_df$logic_vector)
as.numeric(problem_2_df$character_vector)
as.numeric(problem_2_df$factor_vector)
```

The `as.numeric` function converted the `logic_vector` variable to a
binary variable consisting of 0’s and 1’s, which explains how base R
calculated the initial mean for `logic_vector`. R’s decision to use 0’s
and 1’s to represent FALSE and TRUE, respectively, explains why the mean
for this variable is a decimal between 0 and 1. Since these are
established values within R, it will do its best to calculate the mean
for logical variables using these definitions. The `as.numeric` function
does the same action that base R does when working with logical
variables: applies 0’s and 1’s to correspond to `FALSE` and `TRUE`.

Initially, R was unable to calculate a mean for the `factor_vector`
variable because the strings ‘hot’, ‘warm’, and ‘cold’ did not hold
numerical values from which a mean could be calculated. Using the
`as_numeric` function, however, the `factor_vector` variable was
converted to 1’s, 2’s, and 3’s representing the three levels. These
values were assigned alphabetically (‘cold’ = 1, ‘hot’ = 2, ‘warm’ = 3).
Similar to the `logic_vector` variable, R needed to apply values to the
`factor_vector` variable to determine the mean. It’s important to be
mindful of the fact that R assigns these values alphabetically and
recognize that further elaboration in the code using `levels = ...` to
establish the order of the levels may be required to get an accurate
mean for specified levels.

On the other hand, the `character_vector` variable was not able to be
converted using the `as.numeric` function. Unlike the `factor_vector`
variable, `character_vector` does not hold distinct levels or have an
inherent order that R can decipher, even when converted using
`as.numeric`. In summary, R is able to convert categorical ordinal
variables, such as `factor_vector` to numeric variables and calculate
the mean, but cannot do the same for categorical nominal variables, such
as `character_vector`, thus explaining why R introduced NA by coercion,
both initially and when using `as.numeric`.
